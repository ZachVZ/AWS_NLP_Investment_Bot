# AWS_NLP_Investment_Bot

This report creates a bot that will recommend an investment portfolio for a retirement plan by using AWS Lex and Lambda.
Below are the actions that will be performed in this notebook.
1. Configure the initial robo advisor: Define an Amazon Lex bot with a single intent that establishes a conversation about requirements to suggest an investment portfolio for retirement.
2. Build and test the robo advisor: Make sure that your bot works and accurately responds during the conversation with the user.
3. Enhance the robo advisor with an Amazon Lambda function: Create an Amazon Lambda function that validates the user's input and returns the investment portfolio recommendation. This includes testing the Amazon Lambda function and integrating it with the bot.
